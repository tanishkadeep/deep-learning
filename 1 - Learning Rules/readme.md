EXPERIMENT-1

Title: Learning Rules

Aim:  Develop a Python script to execute various learning rules commonly employed in deep learning, including the Hebbian Learning Rule, Perceptron Learning Rule, Delta Learning Rule, Correlation Learning Rule, and OutStar Learning Rule.

Tools: None

Procedure:
1) Initialize the input vectors associated with the target values.
2) Initialize the weights and bias.
3) Set learning rules.
4) Input layer has a unique activation function.
5) Calculate the output.
6) Make adjustments of weights comparing the desired output and target values.
7) Continue the iterations until there is no change of weights.
