# Deep Learning Lab Programs

### List of Programs:

1.	Develop a Python script to execute various learning rules commonly employed in deep learning, including the Hebbian Learning Rule, Perceptron Learning Rule, Delta Learning Rule, Correlation Learning Rule, and OutStar Learning Rule.
2.	Develop a Python program to implement various activation functions, including the sigmoid, tanh (hyperbolic tangent), ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Leaky ReLU, and softmax. The program should include functions to compute the output of each activation function for a given input. Additionally, it should be capable of plotting graphs representing the output of each activation function over a range of input values.
3.	Implementation of Perceptron Networks
4.	Implement basic image processing operations.
5.	Apply style transfer for an images
6.	Implement in python SVM/Softmax classifier for CIFAR-10 dataset
7.	To build multi-layer neural networks
8.	Image segmentation using mask RCNN
9.	Study the effect of batch normalization and dropout in neural network classifier
10.	Chatbot using bidirectional LSTMs
11.	 Image captioning with LSTMs
12.	Object detection with single-stage and two-stage detectors (Yolo)
13.	Implement image captioning with vanilla RNN using seq2seq model
14.	To Learn and implement the DCGAN model to simulate realistic image
