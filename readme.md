# Deep Learning Lab Programs

### List of Programs:

1. Write a python program to implement the learning rules such as Hebbian
 Learning Rule, Perceptron Learning Rule, Delta Learning Rule, Correlation
 Learning Rule, and OutStar Learning Rule in deep learning.
 2. Develop a Python program to implement various activation functions,
 including the sigmoid, tanh (hyperbolic tangent), ReLU (Rectified Linear
 Unit), Leaky ReLU, and softmax. The program should include functions to
 compute the output of each activation function for a given input.
 Additionally, it should be capable of plotting graphs representing the output
 of each activation function over a range of input values.
 3. Implement a python program for Perceptron Networks by considering the given
 scenario. A student wants to make a decision about whether to go for a movie or
 not by looking at 3 parameters using a single neuron. The three inputs are
 Favorite hero, heroine, and Climate. Each has weights and we have a bias in the
 perceptron. If the condition is true input is 1 else input is 0, weights for Favorite
 hero=0.2, heroine=0.4, and Climate=0.2 and bias=-0.5. Output is 1. The decision
 is to go for a movie.Calculate the Accuracy .
 4. Write a program in deep learning to apply image processing operations
 such as Histogram equalization, Thresholding, Edge detection, Data
 augmentation, Morphological Operations.
 5. Implement image style transfer, transforming a given content image to adopt
 the artistic style of another image, using a pre-trained model.
 6. Implement in python SVM/Softmax classifier for CIFAR-10 dataset.
 7. Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify
 handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to train a model that
 accurately identifies digits (0-9) from images.
 8. Design and implement a deep learning model to classify underwater sonar
 signals into two categories (Rocks 'R' or Mines 'M') using the
 sonar_dataset.csv. Evaluate the performance of the model on unseen test data
 and demonstrate the impact of incorporating dropout layers to improve
 generalization.
 9. Implementing a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network
 (DCGAN) to Simulate Realistic Images
10.Study the effect of batch normalization and dropout in neural network
 classifiers.
 11.To implement an object detection and segmentation model using Mask
 R-CNN on agiven image.
 12.To design and implement a customer support chatbot that leverages
 Bidirectional LSTMs to enhance its ability to understand and respond to user
 queries accurately and contextually.
 13. To implement the YOLO model for detecting objects in images from the
 COCOdataset.
 14.To develop a GRU-based RNN model for sentiment analysis on the IMDB
 movie reviews dataset
 15. To implement an automated text summarization system using the T5
 transformer model
