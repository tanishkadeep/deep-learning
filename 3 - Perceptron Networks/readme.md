EXPERIMENT-3

Aim: Implementation of Perceptron Networks

Tools: None

Procedure:
1) Initialize the input vector.
2) Train the network weights for the perceptron.
3) Make predictions with the perceptron.
-	import the necessary libraries
-	Load the dataset
-	Assign the input features to x
-	Assign the target features to y
-	Initialize the Perceptron with the appropriate number of inputs
-	Train the model
-	Predict from the test dataset
-	Find the accuracy of the model
